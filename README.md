# PicturePalet
This is a twitter bot that when you send it two images it will return the second image re-made with the pixels of the first

Here is an example!

The username has changed since the screenshots

Using only the pixels in the first image it will re-create the second image! This is done by pasing the original image
onto the second image and re-size accordinly. After that, we will randomly pick two pixels and switch then if doing
so will bring us closer to creating the second image!
