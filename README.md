# PicturePalet
This is a twitter bot that when you send it two images it will return the second image re-made with the pixels of the first image only.

Here is an example!

The usernames have changed since when these screenshots were taken.

Using only the pixels in the first image it will re-create the second image! This is done by pasing the original image
onto the second image and re-size accordinly. After that, we will randomly pick two pixels and switch then if doing
so will bring us closer to creating the second image!
